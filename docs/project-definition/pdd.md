This is the refined **Product Definition Document (PDD)** for **DailyArc**. I have stripped away the implementation details (like file paths and SDK specifics) to focus purely on the product's vision, user experience, and core business logic.

## 🏗️ The 8-Epic Roadmap

### Epic 1: Adaptive Training & Recovery (The Readiness Loop)

*Focus: Adjusting intensity based on the user's actual physical state.*

* **User Story 1:** As a user, I want to complete a **Daily Readiness Check** (soreness, sleep, stress) so the app can suggest "Deload" sessions when I’m fatigued.
* **User Story 2:** As a trainee, I want a **Muscle Fatigue Heat Map** based on my logs to prevent overtraining specific muscle groups.
* **User Story 3:** As a trainer, I want an **Alert** if a client’s readiness score drops for three days straight so I can check in on them.

### Epic 2: Intelligent Nutrition & Inventory (The Smart Food Engine)

*Focus: Solving the "What can I cook right now?" problem.*

* **User Story 1:** As a user, I want to input my **Inventory** (pantry/fridge) so the app only suggests recipes I already have the ingredients for.
* **User Story 2:** As a user, I want a **"Gap List" generator** to identify missing items for a specific recipe and add them to a shopping list.
* **User Story 3:** As a user, I want **Dynamic Macro Rings** that increase or decrease targets based on that day's workout intensity.

### Epic 3: The "Super-Coach" Portal (Accountability)

*Focus: Giving trainers professional-grade oversight.*

* **User Story 1:** As a trainer, I want to require **Photo Verification** for meals to ensure portion and quality control.
* **User Story 2:** As a trainer, I want a **Risk Dashboard** to see at a glance which clients are missing logs or under-recovering.
* **User Story 3:** As a trainer, I want to set **Micro-Nutrient Goals** (Fiber, Sodium) to manage client inflammation and gut health.

### Epic 4: Predictive Analytics (The "Why")

*Focus: Visualizing progress and predicting plateaus.*

* **User Story 1:** As a user, I want a **Performance Correlation Chart** showing how my sleep/nutrition impacts my lifting volume.
* **User Story 2:** As a user, I want to see my **Progression Tree** to know exactly which variation of an exercise I should master next.

### Epic 5: Unified Communication (The Feedback Loop)

*Focus: Real-time, contextual interaction between coach and client.*

* **User Story 1:** As a user, I want to **attach a video** to a specific set so my trainer can give me form cues (e.g., "Keep your core tighter").
* **User Story 2:** As a trainer, I want to **comment directly on a meal log** to provide instant encouragement or corrections.
* **User Story 3:** As a coach, I want to send **Voice Notes** to build a more personal connection with my trainees.

### Epic 6: Gamification & Community (The Social Arc)

*Focus: Retention through social proof and rewards.*

* **User Story 1:** As a user, I want to join **"Squads"** (e.g., The Handstand Crew) to share progress with people chasing the same goals.
* **User Story 2:** As a user, I want to earn **Arc Badges** for consistency streaks and skill milestones.

### Epic 7: Frictionless Onboarding (The First 7 Days)

*Focus: Reducing the learning curve for new users.*

* **User Story 1:** As a new user, I want an **Onboarding Quiz** that automatically places me on the right level of the Progression Tree.
* **User Story 2:** As a user, I want a **"Quick Scan" pantry tool** to rapidly add common ingredients to my inventory.

### Epic 8: SaaS Foundations (The Business Loop)

*Focus: Monetization and professional scaling.*

* **User Story 1:** As a trainer, I want to **bill my clients directly** for coaching services through DailyArc.
* **User Story 2:** As a trainer, I want to generate **Automated Monthly Progress Reports** to prove the value of my coaching to my clients.

## 🧬 Core Logic & Formulas

### 1. Readiness Adjusted Macros

Daily caloric targets are never static. They are governed by the Readiness Factor ():

* **Readiness Factor ():** A variable between **0.8** (High Fatigue/Stress) and **1.2** (Fully Recovered) based on the morning survey.

### 2. The Calisthenics "Tech Tree"

Progression is calculated via **Mechanical Advantage**. Users move through an "Arc" of difficulty:

## 💎 The "Missing Link" Features (Summary)

| Feature | The Problem It Solves |
| --- | --- |
| **Contextual Chat** | Feedback getting lost. It ties messages directly to a specific workout or meal log. |
| **Inventory-Aware Recipes** | Prevents the "I don't have those ingredients" excuse. |
| **Bio-Feedback Sync** | Prevents injury by suggesting "Active Recovery" when the user is red-lining. |
| **Dining Out Proxy** | Keeps data accurate even when the user is at a restaurant using "Smart-Add" estimations. |
